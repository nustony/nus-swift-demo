# NUS iOS Swift Sample Code

The sample code is not a full or runnable application, it is a part of a project source code that implement Login & Sign Up features. It will let you know:
+ How well the system architecture should be - each feature is implemented as a module: easy to reuse as well as easy to maintain
+ Some frameworks we are using 
+ Multi-storyboard technique
+ Some utility classes which we implemented/used and tested in many projects
